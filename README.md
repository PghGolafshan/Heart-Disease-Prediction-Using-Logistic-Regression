# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
The CSV file contains the heart disease dataset, while the Python (.py) and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files contain the logistic regression and classification code. The project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques and evaluate model performance.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This is a heart disease classification project using Logistic Regression, which predicts heart disease based on medical data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, and ECG results. The dataset contains 16 different features, and the goal is to model and accurately classify the presence or absence of heart disease (using the output column). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
